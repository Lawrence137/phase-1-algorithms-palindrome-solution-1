/*
  Add written explanation of your solution here

   This solution works by first creating an empty string to store the reverse of the word.
  Then it iterates over the characters in the word in reverse order,
   appending each character to the reverseWord string.
    Finally, it compares the original word with its reverse and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
